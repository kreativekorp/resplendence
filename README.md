An earlier version of this application was somewhat popular and much more relevant years ago when Mac OS applications still used resource forks. This version is a rewrite I started back in 2008 and never finished.

To compile and run this application, you will also need to check out and compile the projects [KSFL](https://github.com/kreativekorp/ksfl), [PowerPaint](https://github.com/kreativekorp/powerpaint), and [OpenXION](https://github.com/kreativekorp/openxion).
