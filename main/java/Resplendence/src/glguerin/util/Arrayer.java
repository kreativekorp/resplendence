/**
** An Arrayer is a helper for building variable-length arrays of Objects.
** It has limited capabilities, and is no replacement for a 
** general-purpose collection when that is called for.
** It is far simpler than Vector,
** and is appropriate when you just want to build arrays of Objects by appending them.
**<p>
** One notable feature is that an Arrayer will never append nulls.
** This is intentional, though it differs from Vector.
** Also, an Arrayer cannot remove individual items in the array.
** This, too, is intentional.
**<p>
** An Arrayer can enforce the types of Objects added to the array, unlike Vector.
** It does this simply by using an array of a supplied type,
** and maintaining that type when it expands the array.
